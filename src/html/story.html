    <p>
        First "coding" experience was when we made homepages with writing HTML in notepad and it was fun!

        My short-time jobs include working in plant garden, craft workshop, second-hand shop, furniture factory and as a cleaner.
        I graduated as artisan (Ohjaustoiminnan artesaani) and later as family day carer (Perhepäivähoitaja).
        After I became a mom, I was a Family Day Care Entrepreneur in my own home.

        Although working with kids was my dream, I started to get more and more interested about coding again.
        I participated in Xamk's AMKoodari studies and took Kotlin course in open university.
        Work in Tech Finland programme gave me a chance to learn more about coding and cybersecurity, and prepared me in IT field as a career changer.
        That gave me a push to apply in Kood/Sisu coding school, and I definitely want to continue this path.
        I'm interested in Cybersecurity and Testing, and I feel like Backend is more of my field than Frontend.

        I'd like to have an internship, because I have studied a lot but I don't have yet work experience.
        I want to get to know different languages, programs, techniques, and see what would be my speciality.
        And it's also a good opportunity to teach me to be the right piece in your puzzle when I learn the specific systems in your workplace.
